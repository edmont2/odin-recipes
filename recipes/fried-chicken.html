        <h2>Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>Fried chicken is just amazing! It can be eaten with anything and even by itself.</p>
        <p>I usually prefer to accompany it with white rice and stewed beans.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 or 1/2 of chicken</li>
            <li>canola/vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of seasoning (adobo and sazon)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of garlic (ground or powder)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken with the seasoning (adobo and sazon) and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add canola/vegetable oil into a pot, and heat it to medium high on your stove.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook on medium low until internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Increase temperature to medium high in order to broil the chicken for a crispy finish.</li>
            <li>When the outer skin of the chicken has an orange golden color and it's crispy, they are ready to serve!</li>
        </ol>
